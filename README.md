~~# Kalliope~~

~~Here I will experiment with various things to see if I can make a speech generation model that can be trained on budget but actually sounds good. <br>~~
~~Every checkpoint is going to be architecturally very different. I will cover Russian, Persian, English and maybe Japanese and Arabic.~~


~~Only Russian and English though.~~

~~DISCLAIMER: The samples and the demo (checkpoints and the code maybe soon) provided are as-is. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re good. mostly because I don’t plan on properly training any models for weeks with a good dataset or properly grid-searched hyperparameter values for now. Thanks for your understanding.~~

I'm trying to come up with something better. an Autoregressive or a model with flow matching backbone this time. so archiving this for now.
