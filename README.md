Here I will experiment with various things to see if I can make a speech generation model that can be trained on budget but actually sounds good. <br>
Every checkpoint is going to be architecturally very different. I will cover Russian, Persian, English and maybe Japanese and Arabic.

[a ðŸ¤— demo can be accessed here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Respair/Darya). it uses the ckpts I experimented with so far. 
Only Russian and English though.

DISCLAIMER: The samples and the demo (checkpoints and the code maybe soon) provided are as-is. It doesnâ€™t necessarily mean theyâ€™re good (simply because I donâ€™t plan on properly training any models for weeks with a good dataset or properly grid-searched hyperparameter values for now. Thanks for your understanding.
